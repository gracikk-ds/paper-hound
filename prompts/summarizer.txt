Summarize the research paper. Use clear language throughout.
The report should be at least 1000 words. The main part of the report should be devoted to the "Methodology" section.
Follow the structure and conventions below. NO other unrelated text should be added.

## 1. Motivation of the Research Paper

Answer each question in 1–3 sentences. Use this format:

- **Gap**: [Concrete problem or missing capability in the field]
- **Limitation**: [Why existing methods fail — specific bottleneck, not vague statements]
- **Goal**: [What this paper proposes to solve the gap]
- **Success criteria**: [Measurable outcome that would validate the work]

## 2. Key Contributions and Methodology

**Contributions**:
- [What is introduced] - [Why it matters / improvement over prior work]

**Methodology**:
Provide a comprehensive explanation of how the method or its components work.
You should provide sufficient technical details. Include the equations with explanations if it is needed to understand the full approach.
Do not be vague or skip important details.
Start a new paragraph for each key component.

## 3. Datasets Used / Presented

For each dataset, use this format:
- **[Dataset Name]**: [Size] | [Domain] | [Splits used (train/val/test)]

If a **new dataset is introduced**, add:
- **[New Dataset Name]** *(introduced)*: [Size] | [Domain] | [Splits]
  - *Collection*: [Brief description of how data was gathered]

## 5. Results

- **Compared against**: [Key baselines/competitors in 1 line]
- **Summary**: [2–3 sentences: What benchmarks were tested? How does the model perform overall — SOTA, competitive, or niche wins? Any notable strengths or weaknesses?]
- **Efficiency** *(if reported)*: [Brief comparison vs. baselines — faster/smaller/cheaper or not]

## 6. Ablations *(If none reported, write "Not performed")*

List key ablations on a separate line using this format:
- **[Component removed/changed]**: [Impact — helped/hurt/no effect] - [What this reveals]
