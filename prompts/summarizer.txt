Summarize the research paper. The length of the summary should be ~350–500 words.
Use clear and concise language.
Follow the structure and conventions below. NO other unrelated text should be added.

## 1. Motivation of the Research Paper

* What concrete gap are the authors addressing?
* What breaks because of this gap, and why does it matter?
* Why do existing methods fail (key bottleneck/limitation)?
* What does this paper set out to do to close the gap?
* What would "success" look like for this work?

## 2. Key Contributions and Methodology

* Main contributions (phrased as *what is introduced* + *why it matters*). Compare to prior works if relevant.
* High-level approach: inputs/outputs, core components, and data/compute/training regime if relevant.

## 3. Datasets Used / Presented

* List **all** datasets (training / fine-tuning / evaluation) used in the paper with name, size, domain, and splits.
* Highlight any newly introduced datasets with additional detail.

## 5. Results

* Baselines compared against.
* Primary metrics and headline results (report deltas in concrete human-readable terms).
* Efficiency: compute, latency, parameters, memory, or cost (if reported).

## 6. Ablations *(If none reported, write "Not performed")*

For each ablation tested, report:
- **What was changed**: component removed, replaced, or modified
- **Effect**: metric name, baseline value - ablated value (delta: X%)
- **Implication**: what this reveals about the component's role
