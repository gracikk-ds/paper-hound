Summarize the research paper. Use clear language throughout.
Follow the structure and conventions below. NO other unrelated text should be added.

## 1. Motivation of the Research Paper

Answer each question in 1–3 sentences. Use this format:

- **Gap**: [Concrete problem or missing capability in the field]
- **Limitation**: [Why existing methods fail — specific bottleneck, not vague statements]
- **Goal**: [What this paper proposes to solve the gap]
- **Success criteria**: [Measurable outcome that would validate the work]

## 2. Key Contributions and Methodology

**Contributions**:
- [What is introduced] - [Why it matters / improvement over prior work]

**Methodology**:
Provide a comprehensive explanation of how the method or its components work. Write at least 4-6 sentences with sufficient technical detail to understand the full approach. Do not be vague or skip important details. Start a new paragraph for each key component.

## 3. Datasets Used / Presented

For each dataset, use this format:
- **[Dataset Name]**: [Size] | [Domain] | [Splits used (train/val/test)]

If a **new dataset is introduced**, add:
- **[New Dataset Name]** *(introduced)*: [Size] | [Domain] | [Splits]
  - *Collection*: [Brief description of how data was gathered]

## 5. Results

- **Compared against**: [Key baselines/competitors in 1 line]
- **Summary**: [2–3 sentences: What benchmarks were tested? How does the model perform overall — SOTA, competitive, or niche wins? Any notable strengths or weaknesses?]
- **Efficiency** *(if reported)*: [Brief comparison vs. baselines — faster/smaller/cheaper or not]

## 6. Ablations *(If none reported, write "Not performed")*

List key ablations on a separate line using this format:
- **[Component removed/changed]**: [Impact — helped/hurt/no effect] - [What this reveals]
